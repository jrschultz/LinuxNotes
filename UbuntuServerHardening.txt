Hardening the Server against SSH attacks

sudo vim /etc/ssh/sshd_config

find 
PermitRootLogin no

add anywhere in the file:
AllowUsers jason 

Also can ban password logins over ssh
find
PasswordAuthentication no 
* NOTE: this option will make it impossible to add new SSH keys from new clients to the server

save the file and sudo systemctl restart ssh
