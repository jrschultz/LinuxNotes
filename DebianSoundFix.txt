Had this weird issue where pulse audio wasn't defaulting to HDMI for the speakers in the TV.

set it up properly through the pulse audio audio mixer applet.
top right tabs to Configuration and select Digital Stereo (HDMI) Output

Then in terminal run
pacmd list-sinks | grep -A1 index

That will barf out the current configuration
<alsa_output.pci-0000_00_1f.3.hdmi-stereo>

then sudo vim /etc/pulse/default.pa
on the last line Make Some Devices Default
paste the above line in there without the < > brackets

set-default-sink alsa_output.pci-0000_00_1f.3.hdmi-stereo

That will make the sound setting persistent after reboot.
