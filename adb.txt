# adb tools for android phones/tablets
#
# Used the following steps to fuse a microSD card into the internal memory of the kids tablets when the software won't allow the option to do it.

# Install android-tools-adb 

1. adb shell
as you can see my device has been detected :) !
2. sm list-disks
In my case it is 179, 128. Your case it would be different :)

3. sm list-volumes all
Ok so my sd card is not mounted with the internal storage !

4. sm set-force-adoptable true

5. sm partition disk:179,128 private (In my case it is 179,128) Your case it would be different. 

Now this process will take some time . It will take atleast 5 to 10 minutes :) 
After the complition of this process, now type:

6. sm set-force-adoptable false

Now to check that your sd card has been formated as internal or not, type:

7: sm list-volumes all
As you can see Sd card has been mounted Successfully :)
