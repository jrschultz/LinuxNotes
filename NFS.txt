### Setup NFS Network Shares

## On Server - Debian package name. [nfs-utils on Arch]

sudo apt install nfs-kernel-server

Edit /etc/exports file to add the folder you want to share

Make sure share folder is 775 permissions 

/path/to/SharingFolder (rw,sync,no_subtree_check) 

Note: this will be an "open" share in that everyone with the client setup can connect to the share. You can specify the ip address of the connecting client along with subnet mask to lock it down a bit. For home network it doesn't matter.

Then run

sudo systemctl restart nfs-kernel-server

## On Client

sudo apt install nfs-common

Check to make sure the server is actually serving: 

showmount --exports [SERVER IP ADDRESS]

Make a directory to mount the shared folder to:

mkdir /path/to/MountFolder 

sudo mount [SERVER IP ADDRESS:/path/to/SharingFolder] /path/to/MountFolder

See if it worked by running df -h

You should see the Server Sharing Folder mounted locally on the client machine

To unmount it on the client:

sudo umount /path/to/MountFolder

### Auto Mounting can be done with AutoFS
