## Install and Config ZRam on Debian

sudo apt install zram-tools systemd-zram-generator 

Edit the /etc/FSTab file and comment (#) out the swap line. Save and quit.

Note: SystemD will continue to load the existing swap even with the comment out on the FSTab so you need to shut that off:

systemctl --type swap 

sudo systemctl mask  "dev-*.swap"

Edit /etc/default/zramswap

Uncomment the speed algorithm (ALGO=lz4) and uncomment the PERCENT line & set it for 25%

Uncomment the PRIORITY and leave it at 100

sudo zramswap start

sudo zramctl

reboot
