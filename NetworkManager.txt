I think the applet should be in the network-manager-gnome package. If you don't have it run:
sudo apt-get install network-manager-gnome
Also make sure the network manager service is running. You can check with:
systemctl list-units NetworkManager.service
If it's not loaded you should either start it with:
sudo systemctl start NetworkManager.service
or enable so it will also be there after restarting with:
sudo systemctl enable NetworkManager.service
