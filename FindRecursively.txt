Use Find to find a bunch of files recursively in a directory and copy those files to a folder.


find . -iname "*.pdf" -type f -exec cp {} ./pdfsfolder \;

For .pages documents

find . -iname "*.pages" -type d -exec cp -r {} ./pagesfiles \;

Pages documents show up as directories on linux. Hence the switch to the type d for directory
